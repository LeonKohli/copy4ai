# Copy4AI

![Copy4AI Logo](images/icon.png)

Copy4AI (formerly SnapSource) is a powerful Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to easily copy file and folder contents along with the project tree structure to your clipboard. It automatically ignores dot files, respects .gitignore rules, and provides plaintext, markdown, and XML output formats. This tool is particularly useful when working with Large Language Models (LLMs) and you need to provide context about your project.

## üöÄ Features

- üìã Copy contents of files, folders, or multiple selections to your clipboard along with the project tree structure.
- üîí Configurable dot file handling (.env, .git, .github, etc.).
- üö´ Respect .gitignore rules and custom exclude patterns.
- üå≥ Configurable project tree depth.
- üìÑ Three output formats: plaintext, markdown, and XML.
- ‚ö° Asynchronous processing for improved performance with large directories.
- üõ°Ô∏è Robust error handling for various edge cases.
- üß† Smart binary file detection to exclude non-text content.
- üìè Configurable file size limit to prevent oversized outputs.
- üîß Option to include or exclude project tree structure in the output.
- üóúÔ∏è Simple code compression option for more compact output.
- üßπ Option to remove comments from code.
- üî¢ Token counting and cost estimation for various LLM models.

## üîß How to Use

1. Select one or multiple files or folders in the VS Code Explorer.
2. Right-click and select one of the following options:
   - **Copy to Clipboard (Copy4AI)**: Copies the selected files/folders with their content
   - **Copy Project Structure (Copy4AI)**: Copies only the project tree structure
3. The content will be copied to your clipboard, excluding dot files, binary files, and respecting ignore patterns and size limits.
4. Paste the content into your preferred LLM interface.

Additional commands:
- Use the **Toggle Project Tree (Copy4AI)** command from the Command Palette to quickly enable or disable project tree inclusion in the output without changing settings.
- Use the **Toggle Dot Files Inclusion (Copy4AI)** command from the Command Palette to quickly switch between including or excluding dot files (like .github) without changing settings.

A progress indicator will show the status of the operation, especially useful for large files or when token counting is enabled.

### Exclusion Configuration

The `copy4ai.exclude` setting provides precise control over what files and directories are excluded:

```json
"copy4ai.exclude": {
  "paths": ["src/config", "vendor/unwanted-package"],
  "patterns": ["node_modules", "*.log", "*.tmp"]
}
```

- **paths**: Absolute paths relative to workspace root. These are exact path matches that will exclude specific directories or files regardless of their name. This solves the problem of excluding directories with common names (like "config") in specific locations while keeping others.
- **patterns**: Standard glob patterns for more general exclusions.

> **Note:** In version 1.0.17, the `excludePatterns` setting was replaced with the more flexible `exclude` object. Please update your configuration accordingly.

## üîç Output Formats

1. **Plaintext**: A simple text format with clear sections for project structure (if enabled) and file contents.
2. **Markdown**: A formatted markdown output with code blocks for project structure (if enabled) and file contents.
3. **XML**: A structured XML format with separate sections for project structure and file contents.
